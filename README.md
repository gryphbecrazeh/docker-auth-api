# HOW TO USE

#### PROBABLY SHOULD FIX THIS SO THAT POST TO / CHECKS USER AUTHENTICATION RATHER THAN POST TO /USERS
 / -

- GET 

- POST CREATE USER

 /users - 

- GET USER

- POST CHECK USER AUTHENTICATION

- PUT UPDATE USER

- DELETE DELETE USER

 /auth-check - 

- GET CHECK FOR VALID JWT
	RETURNS CORRESPONDING USER OBJECT IF VALID, DOES NOT RETURN USER PASSWORD
- HAS CACHEING, TIMEOUT EXPIRES CACHE

- CACHING AND TIMEOUT DEFINED IN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

- JWT TOKENS SENT IN HEADERFILE OF GET REQUEST

- JWT SECRET DEFINED IN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
