# HOW TO USE

#### PROBABLY SHOULD FIX THIS SO THAT POST TO / CHECKS USER AUTHENTICATION RATHER THAN POST TO /USERS

/ -

- POST AUTHORIZE USER / LOGIN

/users -

- GET USER - PROTECTED BY AUTH MIDDLEWARE

- POST CREATE USER

- PUT UPDATE USER - PROTECTED BY AUTH MIDDLEWARE

- DELETE DELETE USER - PROTECTED BY AUTH MIDDLEWARE

/auth-check -

- GET CHECK FOR VALID JWT - PROTECTED BY AUTH MIDDLEWARE

      	-  RETURNS CORRESPONDING USER OBJECT IF VALID, DOES NOT RETURN USER PASSWORD

      	- HAS CACHEING, TIMEOUT EXPIRES CACHE

      	- CACHING AND TIMEOUT DEFINED IN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

      	- JWT TOKENS SENT IN HEADERFILE OF GET REQUEST

      	- JWT SECRET DEFINED IN ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
